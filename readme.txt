3)The code is structured to have three different types of nodes for how they work in the graph,
	It is designed to first take the input and decide which values are being searched for
	and which ones are given and modifies the nodes to handle these search paramaters. Then
	it does runs the calculations in the process function. The process function simply does 2
	massive for loops. One for the numerator, one for the denominator. Then it divides the 
	numerator by the denominator, the gives that value to the printout command. Printout simply
	prints out the command. 
4)The code is already compiled for your convience. Please run the command:
	java -jar .\bnet.jar <insert paramaters>
